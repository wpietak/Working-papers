### Strict complementarity of Mises’ and Hayek’s arguments in the economic calculation debate

<i>Presented on the 7th Austrian Economics Meeting Europe in May 2023</i>

Mises’ and Hayek’s arguments in the economic calculation debate are sometimes treated as two separate theories that are meant to show impossibility of rational allocation of economic resources under socialism for two different reasons. The aim of the paper is to prove that this is an inappropriate view, as they are in fact two legs of a single consistent theory, and to show a great importance of this concept in various theoretical investigations. First, argument of economic calculation impossibility in the system without prices by Mises (2012 [1920]) and informative role of market prices argument by Hayek (1945) are presented. Then, entrepreneurial knowledge characteristics developed by Huerta de Soto (2010) are described. Next, it is shown that it is necessary to combine Mises’ and Hayek’s theories together in order to point out the error of Lange (1938) model, and to deeply understand why it is only entrepreneurship and market exchange of production factors that can reveal information required in the production process. Thus emerges a single consistent theory showing how entrepreneurship and profit seeking drive the process of discovering the most efficient allocation of economic resources. This theory has plenty of possible applications, including assessment of ideas of any socialistic or quasi-socialistic systems constraining production means exchange in accordance with profit seeking, but also, e.g., assessment of the hypothesis of information efficiency of financial markets.


### Interest Rate and Changes in General Level of Prices

<i>Presented on the 7th ANNUAL MADRID CONFERENCE ON AUSTRIAN ECONOMICS in October 2023</i>

It is very common in general discourse of economics and finance to focus on changes in general level of prices, expressed as a return on some price index (most often CPI), when it comes to considerations over any sort of interest rates, e.g., rates on deposits or loans, yields on financial assets, discounting rates. A widespread practice is to obtain nominal rate as a sum of real rate and (expected) rate of inflation. However, as we show, it is very relevant for various economic processes (especially interest rates formation) what is the origin of the underlying changes. Even if the impact on a particular price index is similar, consequences for the economy and interest rates may differ, dependent on the origin of changes. We introduce necessary theoretical tools and analyse the impact of various cash-induced and goods-induced changes on the time market and interest rates. The implications of findings are discussed.


### Relationship between Rothbardian Time Market and Garrisonian Market for Loanable Funds

<i>Presented on the 8th Austrian Economics Meeting Europe in June 2024</i>

Time market described by Rothbard (2009 [1962, 1970]) and market for loanable funds described by Garrison (2001) are the two most popular supply-demand models describing formation of interest rates in the Austrian School of Economics. However, the models suffer from some drawbacks in their formulation. Additionally, several differences between both approaches can be identified. In particular, the demand is defined differently by the authors, which leads to discrepancies in terms of certain conclusions. The paper explores the extent of the differences between the models and investigates their implications. Furthermore, weaknesses of the models are identified and analysed. Finally, modifications which could address identified drawbacks and compromise the inconsistencies are proposed.


### Origin of Money, Knowledge and Liquidity

<i>Presented on the 8th ANNUAL MADRID CONFERENCE ON AUSTRIAN ECONOMICS in October 2024</i>

Smith (1976 [1776]) and Menger (2007 [1871]) presented a commonly known theory of the origin of money, according to which, money emerged from barter through a spontaneous process. The theory was presented as a sequence of historical events with each step being closer to the monetary economy. Economic incentives of the individuals pursuing their personal interests were the factor which pushed the process through particular stages. However, this theory could be also perceived as a chain of logical implications which provide us an epistemically valuable praxeological insight, helping understand certain economic phenomena. Indeed, only such statements can be considered an essence of economics, while the course of historical events is irrelevant for economic science itself. The paper presents the theory of the origin of money from such perspective in order to gain epistemic value. Conclusions drawn this way help understand praxeological meaning of money and the roots of the demand for money. It also argues that potential role of authority in money emergence is irrelevant for these conclusions, similarly as anthropological discoveries regarding involvement of debt in the transactions within primitive societies. Finally, the praxeological insight gained this way is applied to explain various phenomena observed in the modern economy and financial market, in particular, liquidity preference and the role of market making.
